# microlensing1

01/2021

This simple script was developed through Google Colab notebook for Astrophysics III classes.

Requires: numpy and matplotlib.
I haven't run it through python compiler other than Google Colab, where it was working fine.

First part of the script calcualtes and plots two microlensing images of a circle which moves over time (just the postions, there's no time axis for the plot).

Second part calculates and plots Paczynski curve (amplification in function of time) for a set of impact paramters where time is in absolute unit of Einstein time.
Other plot shows beta parameter in function of time (again in Einstein time units).

Then third and fourth parts show the first part for objects other than circle. Third shows a stationary letter P (first letter of my name) which was meant to compare the results of this code with code from one of the other project we had at Astrophysics II classes.
Fourth plot shows capabilities of code to handle different shapes if they are given as a series of dots and was made just for fun.
